# Welcome!
What I've done is collect a bunch of simulations that are at least slightly related to our content.
You can work through them, taking notes in your lab notebook about what you observe, and questions you come up with.
In general, these simulations are a sort of 'next level' of understanding from what we covered in class.

There are a couple that are just fun.

# Balancing Act
This one is more just fun.
Or at least I think so.

<font color='blue'>See if you can figure out the relationship so that you can position the third object, with out guessing, to make it balanced.</font>

# Energy Skate Park
We covered energy and conservation of energy, and that is what this deals with.
Make sure that you display the bar graph so that you can see what happens to the energy.

<font color='blue'>What observations can you make about the energy, what happens between the potential and kinetic, and what the thermal energy represent?</font>

# Projectile Motion
Here is one that is just fun.

<font color='blue'>Make observations about what happens when you change the angle (what angle gives you the maximum distance?), does the object you shoot out of the cannon matter (why do you think it is this way?), and any other observations you can make.</font>

# Faraday's Law
This is getting really close to the things we are doing now.
You move the magnet around and you can light up the bulb.
This is called Faraday's Law and it basically means that when you have a changing magnetic field you get a current.
In this simulation the current lights up a light bulb.

<font color="blue">You can show the field lines, and then you can make a picture of how everything interacts.  You can make comparisons of the large and small coils.</font>

# Generator
And here is one that is totally relevant, it is a generator!!!
It might help you explain your lab, so I'm not even going to ask questions about it.

# Circuit lab
Unfortunately I don't have time, or the resources to set all of you up with an electronics bench so you could do all of these things for yourself.
Play around and try to come up with descriptions for the following:

<font color="blue"> Based on your playing around, what do you think voltage mean and how does it effect things?  What do you think resistance is?  And any other terms you can think of.</font>
