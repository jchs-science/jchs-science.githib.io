# Course Overview
[Here is a link to the parent notebook.](https://usd475-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/jeffreyhicks_usd475_org/Ev5RzL1Le8xOiJYuyba-qp0BUFaSZUgUYlGMzjUSEZt0ag?e=igjaJ0){: .btn .btn-outline}

This is a course on Physical Science - all the science that involve tangible things that aren't living.
Mostly Physics and Chemistry.

However, the focus of this course is not necessarily the content.
The main goal is to teach critical thinking and problem solving using science as both the source of the problems to solve and examples of ways we have solved problems in the past.
Hence it is a mixed learning model of learning existing information, and reasoning using information students have collected.

The topics we are going to touch on this year are:
  * Atoms and the Periodic Table
  * Chemistry
  * Human Impact of energy sources
  * Astronomy and Geology
  * Mechanics (Physics)
  * Elecricity and Magnets
  * Waves
