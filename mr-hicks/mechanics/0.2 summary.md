# Summary of All Mechanics

| Vocab | Unit | Equation | Description/Summary |
|------:|:----:|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| Position (P) | m, meters | -- | Where something is |
| Distance (D) | m, meters | $$\Delta P$$ | Change in position |
| Velocity (v) | $$\frac{m}{s}$$, meters per second | $$\frac{\Delta P}{time} = \frac{D}{t}$$ | How fast and what direction |
| Acceleration (a) | $$\frac{m}{s^2}$$, meters per second squared | $$\frac{\Delta V}{time}$$ | Change in velocity |
| Force (F) | N, Newton $$\frac{kgm}{s^2}$$ | $$\Sigma F = m\times a$$ | If motion changes, there must be a force. If there is a force, then the motion must change. |
| Momentum (p) | $$\frac{kgm}{s}$$, kilogram meter per second | $$p = m\times v$$ | See - Conservation of Momentum |
| Conservation of Momementum (CoM) | -- | -- | Total momentum is constant for ALL collisions.  This means that if you add up all the momentum before the collision, it is the same as all the momentum after the collision. |
| Energy (E) | J, Joule, $$\frac{kgm^2}{s^2}$$, kilogram meter squared per second squared | -- | See - Conservation of Energy |
| Conservation of Energy (CoE) | -- | -- | Total energy for a system is constant.  Energy can only change form and is NEVER destroyed. |
| Kinetic Energy (KE) | J | $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ | Energy due to an objects MOTION. |
| Potential Energy (PE) | J | $$PE = m\times g\times h$$ | Energy due to how far an object can fall. Note, $$g=10\frac{m}{s^2}$$. |
