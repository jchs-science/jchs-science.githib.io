# Welcome!
Since I do not have time to get to everyone, nor, is everyone willing to ask.  here is a walk through on how to do the roller coaster toll.
Note, you MUST understand the logic of this toll in order to understand the re-assessment.

# 1 - Energy Perspective

_Note, the idea is that by the end of this you know how to calculate the speed of your marble at the bottom of the first, or any drop.  This allows you to calculate ALL of the values you need if all you have is the starting height, and the time it took to go down the first hill._

## 1.1 - Potential Energy
**What do I want:**
  * Potential Energy

**What do I know:**
  * $$PE = mass\times gravity\times height$$

**Loop back, or re-assess based on what I know**
  * What I _really_ want is mass, gravity, and height

**Want:**
  * mass
  * gravity
  * height

**Know**
  * mass - 1kg (from the picture)
  * gravity - $$10\frac{m}{s^2}$$ - gravity is constant
  * height - 1.25 m (from the picture)

Going back, I can now plug in everything I know and get PE.

$$PE = m\times g\times h = (1kg)(10\frac{m}{s^2})(1.25m)=12.5J$$

## 1.2 - Kinetic Energy
**Want:**
  * Kinetic energy

**Know:**
  * KE = $$\frac{1}{2}mass\times velocity^2$$
  * PE=12.5J
  * ?

**Loop**
  * Well, we do have a theme, we are talking about energy so looking back at our notes we can also add something about CoE
  * Conservation of Energy - energy is constant, and can only change forms.
  * Does this help us?
  * Yes.
    - Think about what CoE tells us.  PE + KE = constant, ALWAYS.
    - At the top of the hill, PE + KE = constant, but the cart is not moving so KE is 0 (where there is no movement, there is no KE), so PE=constant, at the top.
    - At the bottom of the ramp, PE + KE = constant, still, but the cart can't fall any farther, so PE is now 0, hence KE = constant.
    - This means that PE at the top, and KE at the bottom both equal the same constant, so they must equal each other!
    - Hence, KE = PE = 12.5J

Note, this is the hardest step of logic this toll requires.
I did cover this in class, if you look at your notes the PE for a car picked up and the KE for a car moving are the same, so I then told you that a car dropped from a height of 4m must be going 9 m/s when it hits the ground because the PE is converted into KE.

The important part is to NOT give up and keep thinking it through.

## 1.3 - Final Velocity
Now for the math step.

**Want:**
  * Final velocity

**Know:**
  * KE = 12.5J
  * KE = $$\frac{1}{2}\times mass\times velocity^2$$
  * Mass = 1kg

**Loop:**
  * I know all of the variables in the equation for KE except v, so I can solve for v, just like you would solve for x.

| $$KE$$ | = | $$\frac{1}{2}\times mass\times velocity^2$$ |
|-----------------:|:-:|--------------------------------------------|
| 12.5 | = | $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$ |
| 12.5 | = | $$\frac{1}{2}(1)v^2$$ |
| 12.5 | = | $$\frac{1}{2}v^2$$ |
| $$2\times 12.5$$ | = | $$2\times\frac{1}{2}v^2$$ |
| 25 | = | $$v^2$$ |
| $$\sqrt{25}$$ | = | $$\sqrt{v^2}$$ |
| 5 | = | v |

Velocity is $$5\frac{m}{s}$$

Now, if you don't know how to do the math, just ask.

## 1.4 - Momentum
**Want**
  * Momentum

**Know**
  * Momentum = mass times velocity
  * mass = 1kg
  * velocity =  $$5\frac{m}{s}$$

**Loop**
  * Plug everything in $$p = m\times v = (1)(5)$$

Momentum is $$5\frac{kgm}{s}$$

## 1.5 - Average Force
**Want**
  * Average Force

**Know**
  * F = mass times acceleration
  * Time to go down the ramp is 1.5s
  * Mass = 1kg
  * Velocity = 5 m/s

 **Loop**
   * Well, I know the equation is mass times acceleration, and I know mass, and velocity, so what was acceleration again?

**Want**
  * Acceleration

**Know**
  * Acceleration is change in velocity divided by change in time.
  * Staring velocity = 0 m/s
  * Ending velocity = 5 m/s
  * Time it took = 1.5 s

**Loop**
  * Hence, $$a = \frac{5 m/s - 0 m/s}{1.5s} = 3.33 \frac{m}{s^2}$$

**Loop back again...**
  * $$F = m\times a = 1kg \times 3.33 \frac{m}{s^2} = 3.33 N$$

_This method allows for the calculation of your values if all you have is a distance and a time.  For example, if you have the length of your roller coaster, and the total time._

Of note, I'm going to stop with the **Want** and **Know** because writing it out on a website makes all of the steps look much longer than they really are.

## 2.1 Velocity
Velocity is distance divided by time, so it is simply:

$$ v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{2.5m}{1s}=2.5\frac{m}{s}$$

## 2.2 Acceleration
Acceleration is change in velocity divided by time, and the initial velocity was zero because the cart was stationary so:

$$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{final} - v_{initial}}{t} = \frac{2.5m/s - 0m/s}{1s}=2.5\frac{m}{s^2}$$

## 2.3  Force
Force is mass times acceleration so:

$$F = mass \times acceleration = (1kg)\times\left(2.5\frac{m}{s^2}\right)=2.5N$$

## 2.4 Momentum
Momentum is just mass times velocity so:

$$p = m\times v = (1kg) \times (2.5m/s) = 2.5\frac{kgm}{s}$$

## 2.5 Kinetic Energy
And last, we have KE is 1/2 mass times velocity squared so:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}(1kg)\left(2.5\frac{m}{s}\right)^2=3.125J$$


## 2.6 Reflection
I'm not going to give this one away, but think about it.
