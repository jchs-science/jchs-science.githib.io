# This is help for the assessments
{: .no_toc}
Okay, this is a place to try and help outline what you need to do to get your stuff done, since I'm doing a terrible job talking to you one-on-one this year.

# Spaghetti Assessment
Okay, here is the handout that you'll need to complete

[Spaghetti Activity Handout](/units/0 introduction/Images/Spaghetti-Combined/Re-Assessment.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue}

## Help with the Units Section
{: .no_toc}
[Go Here](/units/0 introduction/5 metric#the-bases){: .btn .btn-blue}

That is the section of the website that talks about units.
Use that to help you fill in the units table.

Now, to explain the columns.
  * Unit - This is what the quantity is called.  Most often it is the name of a famous scientist that made discoveries with that quantity.  Example, Isaac Newton did research with force, hence the unit for force is called a newton.
  * Symbol - This is the short name for the unit, usually it is a single letter.  Note, if it is capitalized or not IS important.
  * Equivalent Combination - If the quantity is not one of the 7 base units, then that quantity can be re-written in terms of the 7 base units.  Most of these are on the website.

If you can't find the quantities on the website, then you should start with wikipedia.


## Help with the Conversions Section
{: .no_toc}
[Go here](/units/0 introduction/5 metric#the-prefixes-and-conversions){: .btn .btn-blue}

First thing you should do is highlight all of the prefixes.
That is the first letter in each unit.
If there is only one letter, then the prefix is '-', or blank.

Once you have done that you then pull up that link above and look at that staircase.
You start on the stair of the unit you are starting with, so for the first one you are starting on 'm'.
You then move up to the stair that you are going to, so for the first one, that is '-'.
From 'm' to '-' is one step.
So, you divide the number by a thousand, moving the decimal three places to the left.
Hence the answer is 100 mm = 0.100 m.

## Help with the Proposed Design
{: .no_toc}
Draw a picture of your structure and make sure to label it with METRIC UNITS.
If you do not know how big it was, then use a metric ruler to estimate how big it was and write the estimations on the drawing.

## Help with the Analysis of Structure Test
{: .no_toc}
I want three things here.
  * Describe ***WHAT*** broke on your structure
  * Describe ***WHY*** that part broke on your structure
  * Describe ***HOW*** you would improve your structure if you were to re-build it

The goal is for you to explain your thought process as you go from what broke, to how you would fix it next time.

# Roller Coaster Assessment
At this point, if you have not already done so, it is unlikely that you'll be successful with the re-assessment.
It is NOT easy, and requires that you understand how everything is connected.

The easiest way to get your grade up is to re-write the roller coaster assessment.

[Here is a link to the revised handout that has a table for data calculations](/units/1 mechanics/images/RollerCoaster-WithTable/RollerCoaster-WTable.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue}

## Help with Roller Coaster Design
{: .no_toc}
In this section you should draw a picture of your roller coaster.
The three most essential measurements are the height, distance, and time.
All else are bonus.

## Help with Calculation Table
{: .no_toc}
[Go here](/mr-hicks/mechanics/1.6.5 RollerCoasterToll Help#2---average-velocity-perspective){: .btn .btn-blue}

That is the walk-through for the toll, the 2nd section.
If you look at the calculation table, shown below for convenience.
You will notice that order of the walk-though is the same as the order for the table.
The toll was setup so that if you had the distance and the time, you could then calculate the velocity, acceleration, etc.

So, use the toll to walk you through filling out the table.

[Go here for the equations](/mr-hicks/mechanics/summary){: .btn .btn-blue}

| Quantity | Equation - Look up | Steel | Glass | Wood |
|------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mass | -- | 0.0085 kg | 0.0037 kg | 0.0007 kg |
| Distance | Recorded from the activity |  |  |  |
| Time | Recorded from the activity |  |  |  |
| Velocity |  |  |  |  |
| Acceleration |  |  |  |  |
| Force |  |  |  |  |
| Momentum |  |  |  |  |
| Kinetic Energy |  |  |  |  |
| Height |  |  |  |  |
| Potential Energy |  |  |  |  |

## Help with Writeup
{: .no_toc}
For the writeup, look back at the proficiency scale on the front page of the assessment.
Or look at the image below.

<figure>
<img src="/mr-hicks/mechanics/RollerCoasterProficiencyScale.png" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Proficiency scale for roller coaster with markings to help understand what to do.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you have filled out the calculation chart, then you have already done the part that is crossed off in yellow.
Congratulations!

Next, you need to decide if you want to go for a 3 or a 4.

If going for a 4, you need to answer writeup the sections that are outlined in blue.

If you are going for a 3, you need to answer the writeup sections that are outlined in green.

It will be easiest for you to keep track if you have a separate paragraph for each of the boxes; force, momentum, and energy.

# Speaker/Fan Assessment
[Here is the handout for it](/units/2 em-fields/images/Assessment/EM Assessment.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue}

To be honest, I do not have too much help with this one yet.
What I'll do though is explain better what I'm looking for for each section.

## Engineering design
{: .no_toc}
The easiest place to start is actually comparing your design with a manufactured one.
This is because once you make a comparison, you automatically have three points for improvement.

Next tip, ***ONLY*** make comparisons of things that you can actually change.
I do not care that a manufactured one has better parts, or is made by professionals.
What I care about is how could you re-configure what you already have to make it closer _too_ a manufactured version.
For the speaker, focus on the wire, the magnet, and the cup, the things that you have.
How could you arrange them to make for a better sound?
Same goes for the fan.
How could you arrange the magnet, wire, cup, supports, etc. to have a better fan.

When in doubt, I want to know ***WHY*** much more than I want to know what.

## Electricity and magnetism - Diagram
{: .no_toc}
The best thing you can do here is actually draw your picture on a full sheet of paper and then 'zoom in' on several places where the current, magnetic field, and therefore force are all interacting.
Then you can clearly show the direction of everything.

[Look at the last page of notes here for an example](/mr-hicks/em-fields/2.0 EM Summary.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue}

_Of note, knowing the direction of everything could help with how you could improve your design..._

## Electricity and magnetism - Written
{: .no_toc}
And lastly, describe what is happening in your picture using the vocabulary from this unit.
This is not easy, and what I'm looking for is whether or not you use the vocabulary in a manner that makes sense.
And no, the wire does not energize the magnets and make them vibrate.

# Cellphone Frequency - Waves Assessment
[Here is a handout that you can fill out](/units/3 waves/resources/WavesAssessment/WavesAssessment.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue}

There are three emphasis with this assignment:
  1. Facts about waves - tested as a quiz
      - Definitions of frequency, wavelength, and speed.
      - Explain the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed.
      - Calculate frequency, wavelength, and speed.
  2. Evidence that support your choice
      - Your primary source SHOULD be [https://jchs-science.github.io/waves/assessment](https://jchs-science.github.io/waves/assessment) because that contains the information that is closest related to the class material.
      - You can find any other evidence that you want.
        Here are some ideas:
          * You can look up when past <mark>spectrum auctions</mark> happened and what the outcome of those were
          * You can look up what frequencies the major carriers use and why.
          * [The US government's wireless-spectrum auction: Why it matters (FAQ)](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-us-government-is-auctioning-off-wireless-spectrum-why-you-should-care-faq/)
          * [This wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_wireless_spectrum_auction) has some of the history as to what happened back in 2008.
          * [Article on newer 5G service auctions](https://www.cnet.com/news/fcc-sets-date-for-first-5g-spectrum-auction/)
          * [Some of the fundamentals about how cell networks work](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone.htm?utm_source=email&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=hsw_share)
          * You can work through the activity [here](https://jchs-science.github.io/units/3%20waves/6%20digital.html#activity---storage-comparison) that we didn't get to in class but talks about bandwidth.  Could be useful if you want to know if you really need the 100 Mb/s of the 2500 MHz.
          * Oh, and since I have may or may not have told you, you could look up what cell signals actually are... And use that as evidence.
      - You should find information in those, or your own, that relate back to your frequency.  Part of the task is to read other technical writing.
   3. Source quality.  You must explain _why_ your source is a good one.
      Here are some tests, or checks you can list.
      * Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQG6Tin-1E) on reading laterally (checking multiple sources) 
      * The [CRAAP test](http://libguides.csuchico.edu/c.php?g=414315&p=2822716) and acronym that helps you determine if a source is good.
      * Remember, just because something [looks good](https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/) does not mean that it is!!!
      * IF you want to use wikipedia, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih4dY9i9JKE)

## Advice for a 4
{: .no_toc}
For the waves behavior 4, your best options to get useful insight into how waves work is to use construction materials for you material.
Examples include:
  * Glass
  * Concrete
  * Wood
  * Steel

So, look up the speed of light through those materials, and then compute the wavelength for the your chosen frequency.

For the Scientific Reporting, you want to do two things.
1. Come up with a real life application in one of your evidence.  Meaning, one of your pieces of evidence should be based on something everyday. Like what sort of bit rate do you actually need to watch Disney+?  Or like how close do you have to be to a tower, and then how many towers would your town require?  Something that needs a little extra thinking.
2. You have to think up some reason that someone will say your chosen frequency is not good, and come up with a counter argument to them.  The bit rate example could work out for you in that capacity.
