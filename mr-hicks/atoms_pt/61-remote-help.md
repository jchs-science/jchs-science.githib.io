# Introduction to Help
**insert a video here**

# 1 - Lab Introduction
For this lab there are 2 questions.
For each, you need to have a hypothesis, a statement of what you think the answer to the question is.
Here are 2 sentence starters for the first question:

  * Things have an exact size because ...
  * Things do not have an exact size because ...

For the second question, you should first figure out what density is, hence the research.

Then, come up with your hypothesis.
Here are some starters for that:

  * The density changes with size because ...
  * The density does not change with size because ...

# 2 - Materials Setup Procedure
For this section just write in the three things you used to complete this lab.
If you weren't here in person, then you can just take your best guess at what you did.

# 3 - Data


## 3.1 - Collecting Data
Here are pictures of the candy bar with the ruler so that you can make measurements.

## 3.2 - Sharing Data
Click the button below to open out the summary graph of ALL data in a new tab.

The blue dots represent data students measured off of their small candy bars.
The lines represent the number Mr. Hicks measured with is much larger candy bar.

## 3.3 - Mr. Hicks' Candy Bar
Below is a chart that summarizes the measurements Mr. Hicks made during his three different classes.

| Class            | B1    | B3     | B5     |
|------------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Length(cm)       | 13.81 | 13.782 | 13.785 |
| Width(cm)        | 5.58  | 5.575  | 5.578  |
| Height(cm)       | 0.57  | 0.508  | 0.521  |
| Volume(cm^3)     | 43.92 | 39.032 | 40.06  |
| Mass(g)          | 43.69 | 44.49  | 43.69  |
| Density (g/cm^3) | 0.994 | 1.14   | 1.09   |
