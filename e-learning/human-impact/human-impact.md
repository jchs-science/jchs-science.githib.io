The purpose of this unit is to explore how humans impact the world around us.  Specifically we are going to look at how our energy production methods impact the world around us.

Moving forward, the entire world is shifting from non-renewable to renewable resources.  Renewable continue to become cheaper and cheaper, especially as the environmental cost of non-renewable resources is being factored in.

For this unit you are going to put together a researched argument for one of the following renewable energy sources:

  * Solar  
  * Wind
  * Geothermal
  * Hydroelectric

Your final project can be ANYTHING that presents your research in a professional manner.  Options include PowerPoint, paper, poster, video, etc.  Whatever you do MUST be professional!

Your rubric for your final project is as follows:
