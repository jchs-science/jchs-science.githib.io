# E-Learning with Mr. Hicks
Welcome to these new and different times!
Learning is just as important as ever, and to be honest, this time is a great opportunity to begin developing skills you can use as a lifelong learner.
You are responsible for your time, you are responsible for completing your obligations.

To that end, this part of class is going to be structured a bit different.

  * Each week there will be 2 days of material. Each day has the following:
    * 5ish minute video introducing the topic and the assignment for the day.
    * 20-25ish minute assignment - posted in OneNote

It is my expectation that you check in via either an office hour window, or an email for EACH DAY of work.  This means I want to hear from you twice a week.
