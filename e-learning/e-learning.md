# E-Learning with Mr. Hicks

## Overview
Welcome to these new and different times!
Learning is just as important as ever, and to be honest, this time is a great opportunity to begin developing skills you can use as a lifelong learner.
You are responsible for your time, you are responsible for completing your obligations.

To that end, this part of class is going to be structured a bit different.

  * Each week there will be 2 days of material. Each day has the following:
    * 5ish minute video introducing the topic and the assignment for the day.
    * A discussion board post here in Schoology
    * 20-25ish minute assignment - posted in OneNote

## Grading
As always, I will accept and regrade anything that students do at any time without penalty.
If a student wishes to revise their Analogy Assessment, they can.

Moving forward, grading will be similar.
The assessments ARE what matters.

That being said I'm going to make a concession due to the circumstances.
Every assignment, there are 2 a week, will be entered as a pass/fail grade.
If the student has given it an honest effort, pass.
If the student has done nothing or no effort, fail.
These daily assignments are weighted to 0% as always.
**BUT** If a student has more passes than fails for a unit, they are guaranteed a passing grade of a D on the assessment.

This means, that you should try to complete as MANY of the daily assignments as you can.

## Communication
Here is how you get a hold of me:

  * Through a message in Schoology *(click the mail icon in Schoology, click 'New Message', and send it to 'Jeffrey Hicks')*
  * Office hours online.  There is a link here in Schoology to a Microsoft Team that when you click into it you can join a video feed.  There is also a chat client there.  During my 'Office Hours', I'll be sitting there with that window open waiting...

## Class Hours Schedule
I have a 45 minute window during each of my normal class times.
During **ANY** window you may log in and have a video conference with me.
If after a week or two there are windows that no one is using, I reserve the right to change/remove windows of time.
*(By ANY I mean that even if you aren't in a class you can still log during that window if that time works better for you)*

    <th>Tuesday</th>

    <td>Office Hours</td>
    <td>Office Hours</td>
    <td>Office Hours</td>
    <td>Office Hours</td>

  </tr>
</table>

I'm available by appointment at any other time with at least 24 hours notice.

Should the need arise after the first week or so, I'll consider removing some of the earlier time-slots in favor of some later in the day.
But to start I'm going to stick as close to the normal schedule windows as possible.
