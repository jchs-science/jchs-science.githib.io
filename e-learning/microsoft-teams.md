# Overview
I'm opening another channel of communication during these interesting times.
Microsoft Teams.
[The video at the top of this website is Microsoft's overview of Teams use in education.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/teams)
There are MANY features of Teams I'm not going to use.
What I want to use is the communication features of teams.
It has a more informal chat style communication method that students are probably very familiar with and comfortable with.

## Why
  1. Different modes of communication work for different students, and I need to reach EVERY student.
      
      * One of the features of teams is that there is an app for their phones, and computer, that they can get updates from and chat just like the would in a normal messenger service.  With the advantage that I get to be a moderator.
  
  2. This is a form of communication that is becoming more and more common in workplaces.
    
      * For many years people have exchanged phone numbers with co-workers because the convenience of texting as form of communication is so very useful.  However that blurs lines between professional and work life, and creates privacy issues.  Bringing that form of communication within the ecosystem of a business those concerns are mitigated.
      
      * Students need a place to work on developing a **Professional Voice**.  Communication that is appropriate in a work setting.  It is much easier to *not* have a professional voice when the form of communication is closer than their regular forms of communication. 

## What
Nothing changes.
I'm simply adding a mode of communication between myself and students.
I'm still available through email & Schoology.

# Etiquette
The short of it is...  

    If you would not say something with Mr. Hicks
    standing next to you, then DON'T!

The goal of this platform is to have a space that you can talk science with a group of people.

Examples of **GOOD** conversations to have:

  * Questions about assignments - get a quick answer and that way others won't have to ask either.  They can see the answer I gave.
  * Ask about how *ANYTHING* works.  And I do mean anything.  If you miss those random conversations that we had in class where you would try and 'stump' me, go a head!
  * If you want to chat about some random topic like you would have in class, that you don't mind, or want other people to chime in on.  You can.  But your primary target audience should be me.

Examples of **BAD** conversations:

  * Talking back and forth like you would in text.  This means that you are excluding or ignoring others from your conversation.  ANY conversation is meant for EVERYONE to comment on.
  * Talking about ANYONE, student or otherwise, in a negative manner.
  * Personal topics.  If it is not something you are comfortable with EVERYONE knowing, don't say it.
