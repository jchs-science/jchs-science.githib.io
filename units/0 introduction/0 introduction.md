# Introduction to Science
This is your first year of high school and you might be tempted to think that it is the same song and dance you have been doing your last 8-9 years in school.

NO!

For the first time the empahsis in science is no longer about learning cool facts about the world (don't worry you'll still get some), but rather learning how to observe what happens in the world, make a model that predicts your observations, and then testing that prediction.
This year is designed to transition you into using the full power of science as a tool to evaluate and predict the world around us.

Will your models be terrible, un-doubtably.
BUT, with practice they will get better!
