# Advocacy and Technology
{: .no_toc }
You are transitioning from a child to an adult.
Hence, we want you to reflect on that.

_In your lab notebook, list 10 things that you think change when you transition from a child to an adult._

# Advocacy
When you are a child, your parents, or someone, usually does most of the thinking for you.
As an adult you have to do the thinking.
The strange thing is, no one is psychic so no one knows what you are thinking.
This means that you have to
[advocate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=es&text=advocate){: .btn .btn-outline}
for yourself.
This means that you have to communcate what you need to other people.

Now, you should be respectful and reasonable when you ask others for help.
If you are not respectful and reasonable you will find yourself without friends and will only get help out of authority, not kindness.

There are two main things that you need to do to help advocate for yourself.

  * Organize - You have to know what you need so that you can ask others.  If you are not organized you will not know when you need to ask for an extension on an assigment.
  * Communicate - You have to tell others what you need, or what will help you.  Email, schoology, and even in person can workout well.  Note, written communcation is best if you need something done.  Very few people will remember something that is not written down.  This means that if you are talking to someone and you do not SEE them write it down, you should email/message them a summary of what you talked about with your request.  This is not mean, and will help them as well as you.

# Technology as a Tool
There are two main uses of technology in todays world, as entertainment and as a tool.
Because both are often done on the same device it has become very hard to separate technology as a tool from technology as entertainment.
In school we teach you how to use technology as a tool so that you can get more done with less work.

In order to teach you technology as a tool you must not use it as entertainment.
Here are some ways to help keep the two seperate.

  * Use two different browsers, one for school, one for entertainment.  Don't sign in to any of your social or youtube account on the school browser.  That way when you go to you tube to watch a video for class you are bombarded with all the things you want to watch.  You will also not be as tempted to check social media if you aren't signed in.
  * Always have a purpose when you get out your computer.  If you are like us, you have a routine when you are on the internet, check this and that, and then you can either start working or stop.  To break that habit, only get on your computer when you have a purpose.  To keep yourself honest you can write your purpose on a sticky note, and stick it to your keyboard when you open your computer.  The note can help remind you of what you were wanting to do.
  * DO NOT use your cell phone for any school work.  Cell phones are so personal and setup for entertainment that it is nearly impossible to NOT be distracted on your cell phone.

Remember, if we tell you to get off social media, or stop watching youtube videos it is because we are trying to help you use technology as a tool.
When you can use technology as a tool you can get much more done with much less work, and you will ultimately have MORE free time to do what you want.

# Analog Alternative
There is a huge push to stop using paper for a multitude of reasons.
Let's look at some of those reasons.

   * Paper is bad for the envrioment.  No, not compared to computers.  Paper comes from trees, one of the most renewable materials on the planet.  We can sustainably produce paper by replanting trees we cut down.  Computers on the other hand are made of many, many different materials many of which require mining that perminately alters the land and causes pollution.  Also, paper is SO much easier to recycle than computers.  To recycle a computer you have to seperate all of the different materials, ALL of them...
   * Paper is expensive.  Let's say the computer in front of you cost $1,000.  That is enough to buy 667 pounds of paper, over 133,000 sheets of paper.  If you use that computer for 4 years, you would have the equivalent of 90 sheets of paper a day to use.

There are other reasons to use paper.

  * Paper is faster than computers for drafting.  When you are planning or drafting things, paper is faster because you have no limitations caused by the software.  You want to draw a circle, draw a circle, you need to remember what you just crossed off, just look.
  * Paper has a physical location.  How often have you lost things on your computer?  When you handle paper you have a physical memory of where it is.  Especially if you organize your papers, or keep everything in one notebook.
  * Writing is a physical action and can be satisfing.  No seriously, writing can make you feel accomplished because you are making a physical thing, where as everything can seem fake on a computer.

# Activity - Asking Questions
## First round
  * Pair up
  * One student face the Smartboard, the other sits with their back to the Smartboard
  * The teacher will show a set pictures on the Smartboard.
    * The student facing the board will select a picture.
    * The student with their back to the board will ask questions to try and figure out what the picture is.

## Second Round
  * A new set of pictures will be shown on the smart board.
    * The student facing the board will select a picture.
    * The student with their back to the board will ask questions, but NO yes or no questions, all questions must require a FULL answer.  Continue asking questions till the person guesses the picture.

## Switch and Repeat
Switch positions, and repeat the game.

_In your lab notebook, reflect on which round was easier and why.  Was it easier when you asked yes/no questions, or questions that required longer answers?_
