# Introduction
{: .no_toc }
The whole point of this unit was to expand your thinking about what science is and how scientific thinking can be useful to you no matter what you do.

To that end, we are going to give you a problem to solve that requires you to come up with a solution and then analyze and reflect on your solution.
It doesn't matter if your solution doesn't work, it matters how well you analyze why your solution failed.
