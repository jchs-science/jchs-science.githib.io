## State Standards
### PS2-1
{: .no_toc}

Analyze data to support the claim that Newtonâ€™s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.

    Clarification Statement: Examples of data could include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object sliding down a ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force.

     Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to one-dimensional motion and to macroscopic objects moving at non-relativistic speeds.

### PS2-2
{: .no_toc}

Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is
conserved when there is no net force on the system.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on the quantitative conservation of momentum in interactions and the qualitative meaning of this principle.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems of two macroscopic bodies moving in one dimension.

### PS2-3
{: .no_toc}

Apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes the force on a
macroscopic object during a collision.

    Clarification Statement: Examples of evaluation and refinement could include determining the success of the device at protecting an object from damage and modifying the design to improve it. Examples of a device could include a football helmet or a parachute.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to qualitative evaluations and/or algebraic manipulations.


### PS3-1
{: .no_toc}

Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on explaining the meaning of mathematical expressions used in the model.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to basic algebraic expressions or computations; to systems of two or three components; and to thermal energy, kinetic energy, and/or the energies in gravitational, magnetic, or electric fields.

### PS3-3
{: .no_toc}

Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of devices. Examples of devices could include Rube Goldberg devices, wind turbines, solar cells, solar ovens, and generators. Examples of constraints could include use of renewable energy forms and efficiency.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment for quantitative evaluations is limited to total output for a given input. Assessment is limited to devices constructed with materials provided to students.
