## Units
Motion is described by combinations of length (meters) and time (seconds).

`Distance` is how far apart two things are and is measured in meters.
In math you will learn how to calculate the distance between any two points.
For this class we will stick to simple distances.

`Speed` and `velocity` both describe how fast something is going and have the units

\[frac{\text{meters}{\text{seconds}}=\frac{m}{s}\]

'Acceleration' describes how fast something velocity is changing and has the units:

$$\frac{\text{meters}{\text{seconds squared}}=\frac{m}{s^2}$$
