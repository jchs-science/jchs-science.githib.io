## Additional Resources
  * This should contain any additional resources that are helpful but not deemed essential or included in the unit plan.

## Proficiency Scales
This should contain the proficiency scales for this unit.

## State Standards
### PS2-4
{: .no_toc}
Use mathematical representations of Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects.

    Clarification Statement: Emphasis is on both quantitative and conceptual descriptions of gravitational and electric fields.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems with two objects.

### PS2-5
{: .no_toc}
Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current can produce a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to designing and conducting investigations with provided materials and tools.


### PS3-5
{: .no_toc}
Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction.

    Clarification Statement: Examples of models could include drawings, diagrams, and texts, such as drawings of what happens when two charges of opposite polarity are near each other.

    Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to systems containing two objects.
