For each of the two activities below, walk through the instructions and answer all of the blue questions in your lab notebook.

## Waves on a string
By now you should have played with the yarn on the table.
Where it was hard to measure things accurately with yarn on a table, you can measure things really well on a computer that has a pause button.

1. Setup
  * Mess with the damping and the tension sliders that are at the bottom of the simulation until the string behaves like the yarn did.  
  _You don't have to know what they do, but you should be able to get it close._
  * Once you have it looking right, switch from the 'manual' to the 'oscillate' in the selection box in the top left.
  This will allow you to pause it easily for your measurements.
2. Start the oscillator and then pause it.
  * <font color="blue">Record the frequency and wavelength.</font> 
  _You'll have to click on the 'rulers' in the lower right to display the rulers._
3. Change the frequency, restart the oscillator, wait a bit, then pause it again.
  * <font color="blue">Record the frequency and wavelength.</font>
4. Change the frequency, restart the oscillator, wait a bit, then pause it again.
  * <font color="blue">Record the frequency and wavelength.</font>
5. <font color="blue">Calculate the speed for each of the 3 frequency-wavelengths you measured.</font>
6. <font color="blue">What do you notice about your 3 wave speeds?</font>
7. Change the tension to make it lower.
  * <font color="blue">Record the frequency and wavelength, and calculate the speed for your new wave.</font>
8. <font color="blue">How does the speed compare with the first 3 you measured?</font>
9. <font color="blue">What changed?</font>

## Water, Sound, and Light waves
Here is the deal, you are very familiar with waves on water, kind of familiar with sound as waves, and probably not at all used to thinking of light as waves.
In the following questions, you'll be guided into deeper unknowns little by little, so stick with us!

## Water waves
1. Setup
  * Start with the 'Water'
  * Click on the 'Side View' in the lower left.
  * Click the 'green button' on the spout to start it dripping.
2. Calculate the frequency
  * Pull the timer out of the tool box on in the upper right.
  * When a drop comes out, click start.
  * Stop the timer when the 10th drop comes out.
  * <font color="blue">Record the number of drops, the time it took into your lab notebook.</font>
  * To calculate the frequency, divide the number of drops by the time it took.
  * <font color="blue">Record the frequency in your lab notebook.</font>
3. Measure the wavelength
  * Pause the simulation by pressing the 'pause' button.
  * Pull the tape measure out of the tool box.
  _The tape measure measures from the little '+' sign to the other little '+' sign._
  * <font color="blue">Record the wavelength in your lab notebook.</font>
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a different frequency
  * <font color="blue">Record the number of drops, time it takes, calculated frequency, and wavelength in your notebook.</font>
5. <font color="blue">Calculate the speed for each of your 3 frequency-wavelength pairs.  Record them in your lab notebook.</font>
6. <font color="blue">When you compare the wave speeds, what do you notice?</font>
7. Side versus top view
  * Switch back and forth between the top and side view.
  * <font color="blue">Compare and contrast the side and top view.</font>

## Sound Waves
1. Click the green button on the speaker to start the sound waves.
2. <font color="blue">Compare and contrast the side, top view of the sound with the side and top views of the water.</font>
3. Click the 'Play tone' box over on the right hand side just below the sliders.
  * Slide the frequency down to 'min'
  * <font color="blue">Describe what the tone sounds like.</font>
  * Slide the frequency up to 'max'
  * <font color="blue">Describe what the tone sounds like.</font>
  * <font color="blue">Compare the two frequencies.</font>
4. Measuring the frequency, wavelength, speed for 'min'
  * Set the frequency to 'min'
  * Get out the timer from the toolbox.
  * When a bright white spot appears at the speaker, start the timer.
  * With the timer running, count up 10 white spots, stopping the timer when the 10th spot appears.
  * <font color="blue">Record the number of white spots, the time it took, and then divide them and multiply by 1000 to get the frequency.</font>
  * _You multiply by a 1000 because the timer is in ms so that you can 'see' the sound wave.  Sound waves are much, much, to fast to see so this simulation slows them down by a factor of a 1000._
  * Once you have measured your frequency, you can now measure the wavelength.
  * Let the screen fill with sound waves, and then press pause.
  * Get the tape measure out of the toolbox.
  * <font color="blue">Measure and record the wavelength, make sure to convert the length to meters.</font>
  * _For this, the wavelength is either one bright spot to the next bright spot, or one dark spot to the next dark spot._
  * <font color="blue">Multiply the frequency and wavelength to get the wave speed.</font>
5. Repeat Step 4 with the 'max' frequency.
  * <font color="blue">Measure the frequency, wavelength, and speed for the 'max' frequency.</font>
6. <font color="blue">Compare and contrast the frequency, wavelength, and speed for the 'min' and 'max' frequencies.</font>

## Light
For this, you are going to repeat the measurement steps that you did for sound to get the frequency, wavelength, and speed for three different colors.
_Note, to calculate the frequency you'll need to take the number of colored spots, divided by the time it took, times $$10^{15}$$ because the timer is in femto-seconds.  Yes, light is that much faster than sound._

<font color="blue">Fill out the following table in your lab notebook.</font>

| Data | Color 1 | Color 2 | Color 3 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Color Name |  |  |  |
| # of spots | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Time it took in fs |  |  |  |
| Frequency (number of spots, divided by time, times $$10^{15}$$) |  |  |  |
| Wavelength in nm (what the ruler reads) |  |  |  |
| Wavelength in m |  |  |  |
| Speed of the wave (frequency $$\times$$ wavelength) |  |  |  |

<font color='blue'>Compare and contrast the results for the different colors.</font>
