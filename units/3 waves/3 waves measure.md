# Waves - Measurements
{: .no_toc }
Last class/page, you described waves using your own words.
You made pictures, and then wrote descriptions.

Now, you get to learn the science words.

EQ - _How do I describe frequency, wavelength, and speed._
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .text-blue-000} 

Know - _Science definitions of frequency, wavelength, and speed._
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .text-blue-000} 

Do - _Measure the properties of waves in PHET simulations._
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .text-blue-000}

## Introduction
{: .no_toc}
  * **Frequency** is how fast the wave wiggles
  * **Wavelength** is how far it is from one part of a wiggle to the same part on the next wiggle.
  * **Amplitude** is how big the wiggle is from its highest point to its lowest point.
  * **Speed** is how fast the wave travels.

## Instructions
{: .no_toc}
Your goal out of today is have an understanding of what _frequency_, _wavelength_, _amplitude_, and _wave speed_ is.

Copy down ___ANY___ and ___ALL___ information that you need in your lab notebook so that you can use _frequency_, _wavelength_, _amplitude_, and _wave speed_ to describe waves.

# Vocabulary - Definitions and Examples
Turns out there are only 4 things required to describe a wave.
Frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and speed.

<figcaption>Example of w water wave.</figcaption>
</figure>

| Property | Definition | Symbol | Unit |
|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|-----------------------------------|
| Frequency | $$\text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{# of wiggles}}{\text{Time in seconds}}$$ | f | Hertz - Hz - $$\frac{1}{second}$$ |
| Wavelength | Length from one point on a wave to the same point on the next wave | $$\lambda$$ | meters |
| Amplitude | Height from the highest part to the lowest part | A | Depends on the wave... |
| Speed | Speed is the frequency times the wavelength | c | $$\frac{m}{s}$$ |



## Frequency - f
Frequency, is how many times the wave wiggles in a given period of time.

$$\text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{# of wiggles}}{\text{Time in seconds}}$$

The units are are then just $$\text{Hz}=\frac{1}{\text{s}}$$

To measure frequency there are two ways to do it depending on the picture you have.

### Graph with time on the x-axis
If you have a graph of a wave with time on the x-axis.  The frequency is:

$$\frac{1}{\text{the time from one peak of the wave to the next peak}}$$

<figure>
<img src="./resources/wave-freq.png" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Frequency measurement example.  The one wiggle took about 2 seconds, so the frquency is 0.5 Hz.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Video or moving picture
Simply count the number of high (or low) points that pass in a given point in time.
Look at the video below.
There is about 1 wiggle every 2 seconds, so the frequency is:

$$f=\frac{\text{1 wiggle}}{\text{2 seconds}}=0.5 Hz$$

<figure>
<img src="./resources/wave-freq.gif" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Frequency measurement example.  The frequency is about 1 wave per 2 seconds, so 0.5 Hz.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Wavelength - $$\lambda$$
First things first, $$\lambda$$ (pronounced lamb-da, the greek letter L), is the symbol used for wavelength.

To measure the wavelength just take a ruler and measure from one point to the same point on the next wave.
The easiest is usually to go from one peak to another peak.

<figure>
<img src="./resources/wave-length.png" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Wavelength as measured from one peak to the next.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Amplitude
To measure the amplitude, all you have to do is figure out the distance from the top to of one peak, to the next lowest.
For the units, you'll have to look at the y-axis.

<figure>
<img src="./resources/wave-amplitude.png" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Amplitude of a wave.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Speed
Wave speed is just the product of frequency and wavelength and represents how fast the wave is moving.
Think of a surfer on a wave, the speed the surfer is moving, is the speed of the wave.

<figure>
<img src="./resources/wave-freq.gif" alt="drawing" width="90%"/>
<figcaption>Wave speed - see how each peak moves away from the dripping faucet.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Wave Equation
And now, we have the wave equation:

$$\text{Wave speed} = \text{Frequency}\times\text{Wavelength}$$

$$c = f \times \lambda$$

# Activity - Waves on a string
By now you should have played with the yarn on the table.
Where it was hard to measure things accurately with yarn on a table, you can measure things really well on a computer that has a pause button.

1. Setup
  * Mess with the damping and the tension sliders that are at the bottom of the simulation until the string behaves like the yarn did.  
  _You don't have to know what they do, but you should be able to get it close._
  * Once you have it looking right, switch from the 'manual' to the 'oscillate' in the selection box in the top left.
  This will allow you to pause it easily for your measurements.
2. Start the oscillator and then pause it.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the frequency and wavelength.
    _You'll have to click on the 'rulers' in the lower right to display the rulers._
  </span>
</label>
3. Change the frequency, restart the oscillator, wait a bit, then pause it again.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the frequency and wavelength.
  </span>
</label>
4. Change the frequency, restart the oscillator, wait a bit, then pause it again.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the frequency and wavelength.
  </span>
</label>
5. You now have everything that you need to calculate speed!
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Calculate the speed for each of the 3 frequency-wavelengths you measured.
  </span>
6. Now that you have some speeds, compare them!
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    What do you notice about your 3 wave speeds?
  </span>
</label>
7. Change the tension to make it lower.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the frequency and wavelength, and calculate the speed for your new wave.
  </span>
</label>
8. Since you changed something, another comparison is in order!
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    How does the speed compare with the first 3 you measured?
  </span>
</label>
9. One more question,
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    What changed?

# Water, Sound, and Light waves
Here is the deal, you are very familiar with waves on water, kind of familiar with sound as waves, and probably not at all used to thinking of light as waves.
In the following questions, you'll be guided into deeper unknowns little by little, so stick with us!

  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the number of drops, time it takes, calculated frequency, and wavelength in your notebook.
  </span>
</label>
5. Now time for the speed.

  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Compare and contrast the side and top view.
  </span>
</label>

## Sound Waves

  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Compare and contrast the side, top view of the sound with the side and top views of the water.
  </span>
3. Click the 'Play tone' box over on the right hand side just below the sliders.
  * Slide the frequency down to 'min'
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Describe what the tone sounds like.
  </span>
</label>
  * Slide the frequency up to 'max'
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Describe what the tone sounds like.
  </span>
</label>
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Compare the two frequencies.
  </span>
</label>
4. Measuring the frequency, wavelength, speed for 'min'
  * Set the frequency to 'min'
  * Get out the timer from the toolbox.
  * When a bright white spot appears at the speaker, start the timer.
  * With the timer running, count up 10 white spots, stopping the timer when the 10th spot appears.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Record the number of white spots, the time it took, and then divide them and multiply by 1000 to get the frequency.
  </span>
</label>
  * _You multiply by a 1000 because the timer is in ms so that you can 'see' the sound wave.  Sound waves are much, much, to fast to see so this simulation slows them down by a factor of a 1000._
  * Once you have measured your frequency, you can now measure the wavelength.
  * Let the screen fill with sound waves, and then press pause.
  * Get the tape measure out of the toolbox.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Measure and record the wavelength, make sure to convert the length to meters.
  </span>
</label>
  * _For this, the wavelength is either one bright spot to the next bright spot, or one dark spot to the next dark spot._
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Multiply the frequency and wavelength to get the wave speed.
  </span>
</label>
5. Repeat Step 4 with the 'max' frequency.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Measure the frequency, wavelength, and speed for the 'max' frequency.
  </span>
</label>
6. And, at last for the comparison:
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Compare and contrast the frequency, wavelength, and speed for the 'min' and 'max' frequencies.
  </span>

## Light
For this, you are going to repeat the measurement steps that you did for sound to get the frequency, wavelength, and speed for three different colors.
_Note, to calculate the frequency you'll need to take the number of colored spots, divided by the time it took, times $$10^{15}$$ because the timer is in femto-seconds.  Yes, light is that much faster than sound._

<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Copy the following table into your lab notebook.
