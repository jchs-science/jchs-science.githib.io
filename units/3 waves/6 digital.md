## Introduction
{: .no_toc}
You have heard the word 'digital' your entire life, but do you have any idea what it means?
It turns out that the word is very simply in its definition, **BUT** the consequences are vast.

_For those of you that say math has no use, mathematicians laid the foundations for our current digital age clear back in 1870s!_

# Activity - Digital vs Analog
The whole topic is digital, but you must know what problems digital solves.
To outline this, let's play a game.

## Analog Telephone
For this activity, **you need**:
  * At least one other person, the more the merrier.
  * **X** pieces of paper (where **X** is the number of people in a group), post-it notes, or scrap paper work well.
  

Here is the **procedure**
  * Sit in a circle or some sort of obviously ordered arrangement.  _You'll be passing to your neighbor, so everyone must have a neighbor._
  * Now, everyone in the group draw a picture.  The more elaborate you make the picture the better.  _(An example of a great picture would be a squirrel holding a screwdriver.)_
  * Now, pass your pictures to the right.
  * Look at the picture, and then make a copy of the picture.
  * Place your copy on top of the original.
  * Pass the stack to the right.
  * Looking at ***ONLY*** the top picture, make a copy, and add it to the stack.
  * Once done, pass & repeat.
  * Keep repeating till the stack is with the original person.
  * Flip through the stack and LOL, or even ROFLOL if it is necessary.

Here are some reflection questions for you lab notebook.
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Did the final picture look identical to your starting picture?
  </span>
</label>
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Where does it appear that something went wrong?
  </span>
</label>
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    What was the main factor in determining how closely the two pictures matched?

For this activity, **you need**:
  * At least one other person, the more the merrier.
  * **X** pieces of paper (where **X** is the number of people in a group), post-it notes, or scrap paper work well.
  

Here is the **procedure**
  * Sit in a circle or some sort of obviously ordered arrangement.  _You'll be passing to your neighbor, so everyone must have a neighbor._
  * Now, everyone in the group draw a grid.  2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 31x41, anything.
  * Now, shade in some of the squares in your grid.  Make a picture out of it if you are feeling creative, or random ones are fine.
  * Now, pass your 'pictures' to the right.
  * Look at the 'picture', and then make the grid and the 'picture'.
  * Place your copy on top of the original.
  * Pass the stack to the right.
  * Looking at ***ONLY*** the top picture, make a copy, and add it to the stack.
  * Once done, pass & repeat.
  * Keep repeating till the stack is with the original person.
  * Flip through the stack and yawn.

<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    How did the 'picture' change?

</label>
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    If it did change, where and why did that change occur?
  </span>
</label>
<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Now, if you had a really big grid, say 1920x1080, do you think you could make a pretty good picture?

<label class="tasks-list-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="tasks-list-cb">
  <span class="tasks-list-mark"></span>
  <span class="tasks-list-desc">
    Compare the drawn picture with the grid 'picture'.
  </span>
</label>

Congratulations, you now know why digital is 'better' than analog.
It is super easy to copy accurately.

For those of you that have a lot of free time, or curiosity, here is a video of a comedy act, done by a mathematician, about spreadsheets, that ends with him making a spreadsheet of him making spreadsheets of him making spreadsheets, etc.
