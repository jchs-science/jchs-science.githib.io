# Absorption
{: .no_toc }
Think of friction.
You know that annoying thing that prevents you from going a thousand miles an hour by the time you get to the bottom of the really big hill.

The thing is though, can you think of friction with sound?
How about friction in water waves?
How about friction in light?!?!?

Well, there must be be something otherwise sound would travel on forever right?

The truth is, there is some sort of friction in all waves, it is just called absorption.

Absorption is just when some of the wave energy gets converted into something else, usually heat, just like normal friction.

# More About Waves
There are somethings we haven't told you yet.
But, you can probably figure them out by now.

There are a couple of things that go in to the properties of a wave (frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and speed).
Think back to the activities you did with waves a couple of classes ago and answer the following:
  * <font color="blue">What determines the frequency of a wave?</font>
  * <font color="blue">What determines the amplitude of a wave?</font>
  * <font color="blue">What determines the speed of a wave?</font>

Now, we were being a bit leading, by not asking about the wavelength but here it is.
The frequency AND the amplitude, are both determined by the source, the thing that is making the wave (think of your hand and the yarn).
The speed is determined by the medium (the thing the wave is traveling through) of the wave (think back to what happened when you adjusted the tension in your slinky, or that string simulation.)

The key points are to think about what is the source, and what is medium.

# Absorption Activity
Your goal is to muffle the sound coming out of your phone the best you possibly can.

To do this, you are going to systematically test different materials and see what effect they have on the sound your phone is playing.

The main focus of this activity is for you to write out descriptions of what you are hearing for the different materials.
Sound you can hear, light you cannot.
But, for your assessment you are going to talk about absorption with light, so you can take what you learn about absorption with sound, and try it with light.

**Go and collect the following materials (in a kit) from the front of the room.**
  * Pie tin
  * Styrofoam plate
  * Plastic Cup
  * Felt
  * Cotton balls
  * Stuffing

**Using those materials fill out the following chart in your notebook.  _Make sure that you leave enough space for lots of observations_**
| Object |  |
|-----------------|---|
| Styrofoam Plate |  |
| Plastic Cup |  |
| Felt |  |
| Cotton Balls |  |
| Stuffing |  |
| Pie Tin |  |

<font color="blue">Once you have made all of your observations, design something that will block the sound the best.  Draw up your design and explain WHY you think your design will be best.</font>

Make your design

<font color="blue">Did your design work the way you intended? In what ways did it work as intended or not work as intended?</font>

<font color="blue">Did different materials absorb different frequencies?  Describe what frequencies each material absorbed, high vs low.</font>

<font color="blue">Could you make a better muffler if you think of frequencies?  If so, try it! If not, explain why.</font>

# Conclusion
Answer the following in your lab notebook in complete sentences.
  * <font color='blue'>How have I behaved in class today?</font>
  * <font color='blue'>How could I better contributed to a positive classroom environment.</font>
  * <font color='blue'>Summarize what you learned today in 1 sentence.</font>
  * <font color='blue'>Answer the days essential question (EQ).</font>

# Prep
**Have the following kit for each group**
  * Pie tin
  * Styrofoam plate
  * Plastic Cup
  * Felt
  * Cotton balls
  * Stuffing
