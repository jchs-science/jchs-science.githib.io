# Lab Safety
{: .no_toc }
No one wants to get hurt so it is vital that each and every one of you (students) understand **ALL** of the safety rules for the lab.
Each lab will have some of its own safety rules for that specific lab so it is important to always read the directions for each lab.

There is however a set of safety rules ([English](https://www.flinnsci.com/api/library/Download/80efae9513b548d6999c31d38ac36abe){: .btn .btn-outline}, [Spanish](https://www.flinnsci.com/high-school-student-safety-contract---spanish/dc10495/){: .btn .btn-outline}) that you should know for any lab space you are in.

_Look over the set of safety rules for labs.  In your lab notebook, list which rules are also true for a kitchen and which are not?  Why do you think those rules carry over from the lab to the kitchen?_

# The Commision
## The setup
Your class is an award winning multi-media advertising company.
Your client, _Big Education Inc_, has noticed a recent rise in the accident rate amoungst secondary education institutions (high schools) so they are commisioning you to create a new promtionaly campaign that will appeal to high schoolers.

They want it all, instagram posts, tweets, snaps, videos, posters, professional spokesman, memes, etcetera.
If you can think of it they want it.

## The Requirements
Your class as a whole has to have promotional materials for _**at least**_ 80% of the safety rules (44),

<center>**AND**</center>

in NONE of your promotional materials can _**ANY**__ of the rules be violated.

All media must be turned in by the start of next class.
Each day that high schoolers are not informed more accidents are happening so time is important!

## The Payoff
The media portfolios produced by the classes will be independently judged by the the non-physical-science teachers of the school.
The winning class will have their media presented around the room all year long!

## Clarification
By 'NONE of your promotional materials can _**ANY**__ of the rules be violated' we mean that you can not ever have any one with their hair down in any of your materials.
This means that no matter which set of rules you are making material for, you must have an understanding of all the rules.

You can use any of the equipment or art supplies that are out in the room, or anything that you have with you.
If you need something that is not out, you must ask permission prior to using it.


# Homework
_Take your copy of the safety contract home and go over it with your parents and get their signature.  Bring it back within a week so that you can participate in the labs as opposed to watching from the side!_

# Safety Review of a 2 YouTube Lesson
{: .no_toc}
I had difficulty finding an entire lesson to review so I choose two sets of demonstrations, the first set is done by students, and the second is done by the teacher.

## [11 Fascinating Chemistry Experiments (Compilation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vyboVwyzfU&t=229s)
{: .no_toc}
Since this one is a series of experiments I'll go through each one pointing out the safety violations.

  * First off, the teacher isn't wearing any protective gear.
  * Blue Bottle
      - Student is not wearing gloves, or any safety gear.
      - Hair not pulled back.
      - Blowing into chemicals with a straw? and now gloves.
  * Fire starter
      - Standing right over it as they are mixing it
      - Hair is falling in front almost into the chemicals
      - Again, teacher without any safety gear.
      - No safety glasses!
      - no ventalation
  * Potassium
      - No glasses
      - no ventalation
  * Copper
      - hair down with an open flame.
      - no safety glasses by either the student or teacher.
  * Money that doesn't burn
      - No glasses
      - hair down
      - no safety glasses, 
  * Water thicker
      - hair down
      - no glasses
      - you really shouldn't use regular cups for any experiment
  * Water gun fire-starter
      - Finaly has hair back and glasses
      - not enough ventalation
  * Gummy bear
      - Chemicals are left on the edge of the counter open
      - ventalation
      - noise?
  * Elephant tooth paste,
      - hair in front
      - no glasses!?!
      - huge cuffs on her shirt that cause problems.
      - open fire next to an oxygen producing reaction

An overall reflection is that safety is terrible, or very lax.
The biggest problem was the almost complete lack of eyewear in every case, with hair/improper clothing being a close second.
It seems that most of the practices are inherited from the teacher becaues they are always seen in casual clothes with little to no safety gear in the background.  There was a second teacher that did have a coat and gloves but never glasses.
Because it was a video of showy demonstrations these errors are that much worse because the reactions were often violent and firey in nature.

The video wasn't necessarily long enough, but most containers seemed to be labeled with different utensils used, but I do worry.

This is a video of teacher demonstrating acid and base indicators to her students.
No one has any gloves, eye protection, or PPE of any type.

The next problem is that none of the acids or bases are labeled beyond 'acid' or 'base' with no indication to type or strength.
All chemicals should be handled equally but having no indication of strength is especially problematic.
Especially because since the teacher is doing it all without gloves, the students may think that all acids or bases are safe for handling.

In general the clothing and hair is fine because it appears to be a dress code that students have their hair tied, the problem is that most of the girs hair is long and in front of their sholders so they are at risk of fire if they were using fire.

In short the biggest problem is the teachers lack of PPE.  Since no students are handling anything an arguement could be made they do not need any, but they are still close to the table and exposed.
But the casual handling by the teacher will give students a false sense of comfort as I mentioned earlier.
