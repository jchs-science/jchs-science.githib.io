# Astronomy
To infinity and beyond!!!
Well, not quite that far, we'll leave infinity to math class.
In this unit you'll learn about how all the stuff we have learned so far allows us to learn about the stars!
But only a little bit, we have to save some for the actual astronomy class.

*Note, astronomy is NOT astrology so don't get TOO excited.  We aren't doing horoscopes.*
