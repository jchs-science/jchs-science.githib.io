# About
This page was created and maintained by the JCHS Physical Science teachers to act as a resource for our students.

We had previously used CK-12 to maintain a textbook for our class but we had several issues.

  * The output was a very large PDF that was hard to distribute to students
  * After the initial distribution it was practially impossible to update any of the material throughout the year.
  * It was difficult to maintain.
  * It was difficult for students to both take notes and view the book on their devices.  The PDF did not resize well.
  * We are completely overhauling our units this year and it will be easier to port the old book to a more flexible format than it is to adjust it in place.

The goal of this site is to aliviate some of those problems.
Editing will still be tricky as only one of us is fully comfortable with the system involved.
At the very least however everytime a student accesses the website, it will be the latest version.

## To Do
  * Offline version - some students will not have internet access at home, so there needs to be clear instructions or a clear way to have an offline version.

## Future options
Currently the organization name jchs-science is intended as a universal name for the whole science department.
It is unlikely anytime soon this will branch from just the physical science department to multiple departments, but there is that option.

To do that:

  * Move all of the physical science content to a physical science folder.
  * Setup those folders to have their children be the current units.
  * Make folders for the other classes.
  * Set the side bar order.

Effectively we are just adding another layer to the folder structure.
